## About
Overripe Bananas is a web-based application designed to allow users to view an array of movies that display the movie poster, title, rating, and release date. The user can also search for a movie using the search input form. A user can obtain more details for each movie by clicking on the movie card in the carousel. This will then bring a user to the movie detail page.

## Context
This was our first paired project during Mod 3 at [Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program](https://frontend.turing.edu/), a four- module, seven-month course focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. The application was built over the course of nine days and took roughly 35 hours to complete.
